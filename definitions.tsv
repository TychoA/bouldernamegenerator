daisy chain	A special-purpose type of sling with multiple sewn or tied loops, used in aid and big wall climbing. It is designed to hold a climber's body weight, rather than to arrest a fall, and while the sling as a whole will have a strength rating comparable to that of a standard sling, the individual side loops (pockets) will typically have much lower ratings. This is because a load between the two strength ratings could cause the pocket stitching to break, allowing the attachment device, typically a carabiner, to slide to the end of the sling before being halted by the greater strength of the webbing material itself.

drag	Rope drag occurs when the friction generated from the rope running over the rock and through the quickdraws builds up to the point where it is difficult to move or pull up the rope to clip into protection. There are several ways to prevent rope drag: protection placement that minimizes zig-zagging of the rope and potential for rope being pinched or hooked on a rock, use of long quickdraws like 24-inch alpine draws, and use of double ropes.[27][28]

The anchor consists of a "baby angle" (piton) hammered into a drilled hole, which some climbers believe is stronger in soft rock than expansion bolts, which can crack the rock. They were especially popular on desert routes in the United States and can be still found on many routes.[29][30]

sherpa	A person of the ethnic group of the same name that is located in the Himalaya Mountains. Also a generic term for mountaineering porters in Nepal (usually those working at or above base camp), regardless of their ethnic group.
short fixing	A traditionally belayed lead climber reaches a new belay station and creates an anchor, tying the lead rope off to the anchor. The climber then switches over to self-belaying and continues to climb. Meanwhile, the second climber ascends the fixed rope using ascenders (a.k.a. "jugging") and cleans the pitch. When the second reaches the belay, they anchor in and start to belay the leader in the traditional way again. When the leader reaches the next belay the process is repeated.
side pull	A hold that needs to be gripped with a sideways pull towards the body.[9]
simul climbing	A technique in which two climbers move simultaneously upward, with the leader placing protection which the second removes as they advance. A device known as a Tibloc which allows the rope to only move in a single direction is sometimes used to prevent the second climber from accidentally pulling the lead climber off should the second slip.[43]
single-rope technique (srt)	The use of a single rope where one or both ends of the rope are attached to fixed anchor points.
sit and spin	A method of starting a rappel from a cliff edge, accomplished by sitting with legs over the edge and then spinning around to face the cliff while planting feet on the face.
skittling	Climbing without following any specific color in a gym that uses color-designated routes or problems.
skyhook	A small hook which gives hold on small protrusions on watery and slippery grips. Most often used for placements, often extremely marginal, in aid climbing, although they also feature in some extreme free routes. Additionally, a skyhook can be attached to a harness, thus allowing the climber to rest, or held in one or both hands to hold a grip.
slab climbing	A type of climbing, and its associated techniques, involved in climbing rock that is less than vertical and devoid of large or secure holds. The emphasis is on balance, footwork, and making use of very small features or rough spots on the rock for friction.
slcd	An abbreviation for spring-loaded camming device, a type of protection device. These are better known by the term cam.
smearing	To make use of friction on the sole of the climbing shoe in the absence of any useful footholds.[10]
smedging	Smearing on an edge, especially on a dime edge or any linear hold that is too small to stand on or use as an ordinary positive hold.
snarg	A type of tubular ice screw that is inserted by hammering.
snow fluke	An angled aluminium plate attached to a metal cable. The fluke is buried into snow and typically used as a deadman anchor.
soupy	A hold that is wet and slimy from water or some other source.
spinner	In indoor climbing, a hold that is not secure and spins in place when weight is applied.
spike	See horn.
static rope	A non-elastic rope. Compare dynamic rope.
steep	Descriptive of any climbing face that is angled beyond vertical. See overhang.
step cutting	Scooping steps out of snow or ice with the adze of an ice axe.
step kicking	Scooping and stamping steps out of soft snow with the feet.
sticht plate	A belay device consisting of a flat plate with a pair of slots. Named after the inventor Fritz Sticht.
stick clip	A long stick or extendable pole on the end of which a climber can affix a quickdraw. It allows the climber to clip a quickdraw to the first bolt on a sport climb while still standing on the ground. This is especially useful if the first bolt is high up and out of the climber's comfort zone. A stick clip can be bought, easily made, or even improvised when needed.
sticky rubber	Rubber with enhanced frictional properties used on the soles of climbing shoes; originally introduced in the 1980s (on Boreal's Firé shoes) but now ubiquitous.
stopper	1.  A wedge-shaped nut made by Black Diamond.2.  A knot used to prevent a rope from running through a piece of equipment.
swami belt	A kind of proto-climbing harness consisting of a long length of tubular webbing wrapped several times around the climber's body and secured with a water knot. Largely eschewed today in favor of commercial harnesses.
sweeper	The last member or the tail of a climbing group. The sweeper's task is to spot and retrieve things that may have accidentally fallen from the preceding climbers; to make sure that no mess or gear is left behind; and to make sure that the rear is keeping up with the whole team. The term sweeper, a Filipino contribution to mountaineering vocabulary, was introduced in 1998 and was inspired by the Cleaner, a character in the 1990 film Nikita.
swinging-lieback	A dynamic form of the lieback, rotating off one foot while maintaining a grip with one hand, then grabbing a high handhold at the deadpoint of the swing with the other hand. This move is frequently reversible, unlike more aerial dynos.
take	Called out by a climber when requesting that the belayer remove all slack. See hangdogging.
talus	An area of large rock fragments on a mountainside that may vary from house-sized to the size of a small backpack. The area, if older and consolidated, may be stable, or the rocks may be precariously balanced. Talus is distinguished from scree in that it is composed of larger rocks and may feature solid interlocking of the rocks, while scree is by definition loose.
teabagging	When, after a whipper or long fall, a climber falls past their belayer, who is generally lifted up off the ground.
technical climbing	Climbing involving a rope and some means of protection, particularly as opposed to scrambling or glacier travel (i.e. non-technical climbing).
technique	A specialized move given a name to help communicate to another person what to do.
tendu	From the French word meaning "outstretched". In this grip the fingers are close to the position when the hand is open. The relative angle between the finger bones is gradual. The load applied is coming from tension in the forearm muscles.
tension	A technique for maintaining balance using a taut rope through a point of protection.
testpiece	A climb that is representative of the hardest, best climbs in an area.
thread	A runner created by threading a sling around a jammed block or through a hole in the rock.
thrutching	Making progress by squeezing into a space and wriggling against opposing rock surfaces.
tie-in points	The leg straps and waist belt of a climbing harness create two loops connecting the belay loop. The points which you tie in at.
toe hook	A toe hook is securing the upper side of the toes on a hold.[10] It helps pull the body inwards, towards the wall. The toe hook is often used on overhanging rock where it helps to keep the body from swinging away from the wall.
top-out	To complete a route by ascending over the top of the structure being climbed.
tracking	See feet follow.
traditional climbing	A style of climbing that emphasizes the adventure and exploratory nature of climbing. While sport climbing generally makes use of pre-placed protection ("bolts"), traditional (or "trad") climbing involves the placement of one's own protection during the climb, which is generally carried by climbers on a rack.
training	Getting prepared to climb on difficult mountains or routes. The Hangboard Repeaters protocol is a common method of training for climbing.[44]
tramming	A technique that is typically used while lowering and cleaning gear from an overhanging and/or traversing route. A quickdraw is clipped between the climber's harness and the rope that is threaded through the gear. As the climber is lowered by the belayer, the quickdraw holds the cleaner close to the wall and following the line of the route. Without the quickdraw, the climber would lower straight down, further and further from the remaining gear to be cleaned.
tricam	A simple camming protection device that has no moving parts.
tuber	A tubular belay device.
tufa	1.  A limestone rib formation that protrudes from the wall which can sometimes fit within the pinching grasp of a climber's hand.2.  A plastic, bolted-on bouldering hold designed to replicate such a formation on an indoor climbing wall.
twin ropes	A system in which the climber uses two thin ropes instead of one thicker one, but unlike double ropes, twin ropes have to be clipped through the same carabiner for each piece of protection. Twin ropes are often used by trad and alpine climbers. They allow full pitch rappelling and help reduce the chances for accidental cutting of the rope by sharp rock edges.[26]
twist-lock	A climbing technique often used in conjunction with back-stepping, especially useful on overhanging sections. Hips are held perpendicular to the wall, feet press down in unison, and the outside arm pulls down and in towards the torso.
two-man stand	An outdated climbing technique in which one climber stands on the shoulders of another climber as an assist in climbing.
udge	A technique needed to make slow upwards progress on holdless rock, especially off-width cracks.[45]
undercling	A hold which is gripped with the palm of the hand facing upwards.[9][46][47]
"v"-grade	A technical grading system for bouldering problems, invented by John Sherman.
v-thread	A type of abseiling point used especially in winter and in ice climbing.
verglas	A thin coating of ice that forms over rocks when rainfall or melting snow freezes on rock. Hard to climb on as there is usually insufficient depth for crampons to have reliable penetration. See also clear ice and glaze ice.
wad	A good climber. The term may have originated in Sheffield.[citation needed][46]
wand	A bamboo stick with a small flag on top used to mark paths over glaciers and snow fields.
webbing	A hollow and flat nylon strip, mainly used to make slings.
webolette	A piece of webbing with eyes sewn into the ends which can be used in place of a cordelette.
weighting	Any time a rope sustains the weight of the climber, e.g. "weighting the rope". This can happen during a minor fall, a whipper (long fall), or simply by resting while hanging on the belay rope. See also hangdogging.
whipper	A lead fall from above and to the side of the last clip, whipping oneself downwards and in an arc. The term has come to denote any fall beyond the last placed or clipped piece of protection.
wires	See nuts.
wolf moon	To complete a lead climb during the nighttime.
woodie	A homemade climbing wall. Often specifically a hybrid between a climbing wall and a fingerboard. Specifically called such because of the wooden panels (usually left unpainted) used to attach the climbing holds.
x (protection rating)	A rating from the Yosemite Decimal System given to climbs that have very poor or no protection. These climbs often present risk of serious injury or death if a fall were to occur, even if the climb is properly protected.
xeno	A hold appearing to be composed of a different type of rock than the surrounding rock face.
yabo	Another name for a sit start, named after John "Yabo" Yablonski.[48]
yard up	To pull on the rope to make upward progress, often with assistance from the belayer. This may be done to bypass a crux or to quickly regain ground lost after a fall without re-climbing the section.
yosemite decimal system	A numerical system for rating the difficulty of walks, hikes, and climbs, used primarily in the United States. The rock climbing (5.x) portion of the scale is the most common grading system used in the US. The scale starts with the easiest grades at 5.0 and is open-ended on the harder end. As of September 2017[update], the most difficult grade was 5.15d.
zawn	In the UK, a deep, narrow inlet in a sea cliff which is filled by the sea at high tide.
z-clipping	Clipping into a piece of protection with the segment of rope from beneath the previous piece of protection, resulting in a potentially dangerous tangled configuration of the belay rope. If not corrected, this can result in high drag.
zipper fall	A fall in which each piece of protection fails in turn. In some cases, when the rope comes taut during a fall, the protection can fail from the bottom up, especially if the first piece was not placed to account for outward and/or upward force.
z-pulley	A particular configuration of rope, anchors, and pulleys typically used to extricate a climber after falling into a crevasse.
